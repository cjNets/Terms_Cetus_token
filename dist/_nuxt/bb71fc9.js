The purpose of CETUS is to facilitate the participation in the\n      "Cetus" protocol (the Cetus protocol) which, when fully developed, is envisaged to be a DEX and concentrated\n      liquidity protocol built on Sui and Aptos blockchain. It introduces a "concentrated liquidity protocol"\n      through a series of affiliate interoperable functional modules in order to enhance network efficiency. It is\n      important to note that the Cetus protocol simply comprises a set of blockchain-based smart contracts\n      deployed on Aptos and Sui, operated directly by users calling functions on it (which allows them to interact\n      with other users and/or pool their own selected assets in a multi-party peer-to-peer manner). Users can\n      either trade against liquidity reserves at prices determined by a specific formula, or provide their\n      liquidity to the liquidity reserves in exchange for a portion of the fees generated by ongoing swaps. There\n      is no further control by or interaction with the original entity which had deployed the smart contract,\n      which entity solely functions as a provider of technical tools for users, and is not offering any sort of\n      securities product or regulated service nor does it hold any user assets on custody. The Cetus protocol is\n      not, and will in no case be, an enterprise, corporation, partnership or other entity or body corporate\n      established under the laws of any jurisdiction, but a computerised software algorithm based on which a\n      public transaction ledger for transactions thereon may generated.\n      '),t("br"),e._v(" "),t("br"),e._v("\n      CETUS is designed to be the only mechanism by which a user may obtain access to certain products and\n      services on the Cetus protocol (when the same is completed and deployed). It is not intended to be a medium\n      of exchange accepted by the public, or a section of the public, as payment for goods or services or for the\n      discharge of a debt. For each exchange of services or products on the Cetus protocol, the costs are to be\n      quantified in CETUS and paid to the Cetus protocol and/or the other party providing the service. The goal of\n      introducing CETUS is to provide a convenient and secure mode of payment and settlement between participants\n      who interact within the Cetus protocol. Further, CETUS is to be paid to users as incentives for\n      contributions to and/or maintenance of the Cetus protocol. Given that additional CETUS will be awarded to a\n      user based only on its actual usage, activity and contribution on the Cetus protocol, users and/or holders\n      of CETUS which did not actively participate in the Cetus protocol will not receive any CETUS incentives.\n      "),t("br"),e._v(" "),t("br"),e._v("\n      The precise scope of the Cetus protocol will be developed further and will be announced once finalised.

The right to\n      vote is restricted solely to voting on features of Cetus; it does not entitle CETUS/xCETUS holders to vote\n      on the operation and management of the Company, its affiliates, or their assets or the disposition of such\n      assets to token holders, or select the board of directors or similar bodies of these entities, or determine\n      the development direction of these entities, nor does CETUS/xCETUS constitute any equity interest in any of\n      these entities or any collective investment scheme; the arrangement is not intended to be any form of joint\n      venture or partnership; and in addition to governance utilities, CETUS functions as a loyalty membership\n      point which embeds a license granting active participants exclusive access to selected products or services.\n      By holding the staked version (xCETUS), users may upgrade their loyalty tier (based on the amount of xCETUS\n      held, as well as user activity). The premium loyalty tiers would allow users to get greater access to the\n      ecosystem features and more preferential terms, for example certain premium functionalities, exclusive\n      products/services, or greater or more unique transaction rewards. For the avoidance of doubt, the community\n      does not have legal control over any matters relating to the Seller (or any of its affiliates) or any of its\n      assets, or any of its affiliated companies (including without limitation the selection of governing board of\n      the relevant company, over corporate matters, development direction, specific projects, or deployment of\n      that company's assets, which shall be the final responsibility of the governing board of the relevant\n      company).\n      "),t("br"),e._v(" "),t("br"),e._v("\n      Immediately after the token sale phase, CETUS would have limited functionality.
