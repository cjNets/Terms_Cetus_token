        CETUS
        IS AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE CETUS PROTOCOL, WHICH IS AN EXPERIMENTAL PROOF-OF-CONCEPT
        ECOSYSTEM AS DEFINED WITHIN THE TOKEN DOCUMENTATION. THESE TERMS AND ALL INFORMATION RELATING TO THESE TERMS
        SHOULD BE INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED AND CONFIRMED. NEITHER THE SELLER NOR ANY GROUP ENTITY ACCEPTS ANY
        LIABILITY FOR
        ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE WHATSOEVER CAUSED IN RELIANCE UPON SUCH INFORMATION OR SERVICES.
        <br />
        <br />
        These Terms constitute a binding legal agreement between you and the Seller. It contains the terms that
        govern your purchase of CETUS as well as any smart contracts (if any) related to the purchase and/or
        distribution of CETUS.
        The purchase price for CETUS shall be as indicated on the public token sale website, and may be payable in
        SUI tokens to the Seller's designated wallet address. However, do note that the full amount of SUI which you
        commit to the CETUS public token sale round merely constitutes a request to participate and indicates your
        readiness to utilise the full amount to purchase CETUS tokens at the indicated price, but the Seller may not
        be able to accept your full committed amount in the CETUS public token sale round. The portion of the
        committed amount which will be accepted in the CETUS public token sale round shall be determined as follows:
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>
          - For the CETUS public token sale round there will be a maximum limit on the total value of CETUS available
          (the Hard Cap), as separately notified to you by the Seller.
        </span>
        <span>
          - In allocating CETUS to be sold to purchasers, the Seller will first allocate CETUS tokens to "whitelisted"
          users (selected based on special contributions to or partnerships for the benefit of Cetus protocol, and
          determined by the Seller at its sole discretion), up to the full amount of CETUS set aside for whitelisted
          users (the Whitelist Quota). Each "whitelisted" user also has a corresponding maximum protected amount
          individually (the Individual Whitelist Quota). For the avoidance of doubt, amount committed by a whitelisted
          user in excess of its Individual Whitelist Quota or amounts committed by whitelisted users in excess of the
          Whitelist Quota shall follow the allocation rules set out below.
        </span>
        <span>
          - Where the aggregate committed amount from all purchasers in the CETUS public token sale is less than the
          Hard Cap (less the utilised Whitelist Quota), each purchaser's committed amount shall be fully accepted at
          the indicated purchase price.
        </span>
        <span>
          - Where the aggregate committed amount from all purchasers in the CETUS public token sale exceeds the Hard
          Cap (less the utilised Whitelist Quota), each purchaser's final purchase amount accepted by the Seller will
          be a portion of their committed amount, calculated proportional to all the respective committed amounts from
          all purchasers in the CETUS public token sale.
        </span>
        <br />
        <div class="title">1. PURPOSE AND USAGE OF TOKENS</div>
        <br />
        CETUS is a cryptographic utility token. The purpose of CETUS is to facilitate the participation in the
        "Cetus" protocol (the Cetus protocol) which, when fully developed, is envisaged to be a DEX and concentrated
        liquidity protocol built on Sui and Aptos blockchain. It introduces a "concentrated liquidity protocol"
        through a series of affiliate interoperable functional modules in order to enhance network efficiency. It is
        important to note that the Cetus protocol simply comprises a set of blockchain-based smart contracts
        deployed on Aptos and Sui, operated directly by users calling functions on it (which allows them to interact
        with other users and/or pool their own selected assets in a multi-party peer-to-peer manner). Users can
        either trade against liquidity reserves at prices determined by a specific formula, or provide their
        liquidity to the liquidity reserves in exchange for a portion of the fees generated by ongoing swaps. There
        is no further control by or interaction with the original entity which had deployed the smart contract,
        which entity solely functions as a provider of technical tools for users, and is not offering any sort of
        securities product or regulated service nor does it hold any user assets on custody. The Cetus protocol is
        not, and will in no case be, an enterprise, corporation, partnership or other entity or body corporate
        established under the laws of any jurisdiction, but a computerised software algorithm based on which a
        public transaction ledger for transactions thereon may generated.
        <br />
        <br />
        CETUS is designed to be the only mechanism by which a user may obtain access to certain products and
        services on the Cetus protocol (when the same is completed and deployed). It is not intended to be a medium
        of exchange accepted by the public, or a section of the public, as payment for goods or services or for the
        discharge of a debt. For each exchange of services or products on the Cetus protocol, the costs are to be
        quantified in CETUS and paid to the Cetus protocol and/or the other party providing the service. The goal of
        introducing CETUS is to provide a convenient and secure mode of payment and settlement between participants
        who interact within the Cetus protocol. Further, CETUS is to be paid to users as incentives for
        contributions to and/or maintenance of the Cetus protocol. Given that additional CETUS will be awarded to a
        user based only on its actual usage, activity and contribution on the Cetus protocol, users and/or holders
        of CETUS which did not actively participate in the Cetus protocol will not receive any CETUS incentives.
        <br />
        <br />
        The precise scope of the Cetus protocol will be developed further and will be announced once finalised. The
        following features are planned for CETUS: (a) to promote decentralised community governance for the network,
        Cetus would allow holders to propose and vote on governance proposals to determine future features, upgrades
        and/or parameters of Cetus, with voting weight calculated in proportion to CETUS staked (which is then
        converted to non-transferable xCETUS, an escrowed governance token, to represent voting power). The right to
        vote is restricted solely to voting on features of Cetus; it does not entitle CETUS/xCETUS holders to vote
        on the operation and management of the Company, its affiliates, or their assets or the disposition of such
        assets to token holders, or select the board of directors or similar bodies of these entities, or determine
        the development direction of these entities, nor does CETUS/xCETUS constitute any equity interest in any of
        these entities or any collective investment scheme; the arrangement is not intended to be any form of joint
        venture or partnership; and in addition to governance utilities, CETUS functions as a loyalty membership
        point which embeds a license granting active participants exclusive access to selected products or services.
        By holding the staked version (xCETUS), users may upgrade their loyalty tier (based on the amount of xCETUS
        held, as well as user activity). The premium loyalty tiers would allow users to get greater access to the
        ecosystem features and more preferential terms, for example certain premium functionalities, exclusive
        products/services, or greater or more unique transaction rewards. For the avoidance of doubt, the community
        does not have legal control over any matters relating to the Seller (or any of its affiliates) or any of its
        assets, or any of its affiliated companies (including without limitation the selection of governing board of
        the relevant company, over corporate matters, development direction, specific projects, or deployment of
        that company's assets, which shall be the final responsibility of the governing board of the relevant
        company).
        <br />
        <br />
        Immediately after the token sale phase, CETUS would have limited functionality. As development of the Cetus
        protocol progresses further, the various features of CETUS would be implemented incrementally and become
        available over time.
        <br />
        <br />
        CETUS is an integral and indispensable part of the Cetus protocol because in the absence of CETUS, there
        would be no common unit of exchange for goods and services or economic incentive to motivate users to
        contribute, thus rendering the ecosystem on the Cetus protocol unsustainable. The ownership of CETUS carries
        no rights, express or implied, in the Seller, its related entitles or its affiliates (each, a Group Entity)
        other than the right to use CETUS as a means to enable usage of and interaction with the Cetus protocol,
        upon the successful development and deployment of the Cetus protocol. CETUS is sold as a useable virtual
        good, and does not have any functionality or utility outside the ecosystem on the Cetus protocol –
        accordingly it is not necessarily merchantable and does not necessarily have any other use or value. The
        ecosystem on the Cetus protocol is structured as a "closed system" insofar as the usage of CETUS is
        concerned. Further, CETUS is not a consumer product and to the maximum extent permitted by law, its holders
        accept explicitly and agree that they are not covered by the consumer protection regulation of any
        jurisdiction.
        <br />
        <br />
        You agree that, if deemed desirable by the Seller, the Seller shall at any time be entitled to re-position,
        re-brand, re-package or re-market the "Cetus" brand/image/goodwill, the Cetus protocol and/or CETUS,
        including selection of a new token ticker or name.
        <br />
        <br />
        You understand and accept that CETUS:
        <br />
        <br />
        a. may only be utilised on the Cetus protocol, is non-refundable and cannot be exchanged for cash (or its
        equivalent value in any other virtual currency) or any payment obligation by any Group Entity;
        <br />
        <br />
        b. does not represent or confer on you any ownership right, shareholding, participation, right, title, or
        interest of any form with respect to any Group Entity or any other company, enterprise or undertaking, or
        any of their revenues or assets, including without limitation any right to receive future revenue,
        dividends, shares, ownership right or stake, share or security, any voting, distribution, redemption,
        liquidation, proprietary (including all forms of intellectual property), right to receive accounts,
        financial statements or other financial data, the right to requisition or participate in shareholder
        meetings, the right to nominate a director or other financial or legal rights or equivalent rights, or
        intellectual property rights or any other form of participation in or relating to the Cetus protocol, any
        Group Entity and/or any service provider of any Group Entity;
        <br />
        <br />
        c. is not intended to be a representation of currency or money (whether fiat or virtual or any form of
        electronic money), security, commodity, bond, debt instrument, unit in a collective investment scheme or any
        other kind of financial instrument or investment;
        <br />
        <br />
        d. is not intended to represent any rights under a contract for differences or under any other contract the
        purpose or pretended purpose of which is to secure a profit or avoid a loss;
        <br />
        <br />
        e. is not a loan to any Group Entity and is not intended to represent a debt owed by any Group Entity, and
        there shall be no expectation of profit or interest income arising in connection therewith;
        <br />
        <br />
        f. does not provide you with any ownership or other interest in any Group Entity;
        <br />
        <br />
        g. is not any form of financial derivative;
        <br />
        <br />
        h. is not any form of commercial paper or negotiable instrument;
        <br />
        <br />
        i. will not entitle token holders to any promise of fees, dividends, revenue, profits or investment returns,
        nor should there be any such expectation;
        <br />
        <br />
        j. is not any note, debenture, warrant or other certificate that entitles the holder to any interest,
        dividend or any kind of return from any Group Entity or any person;
        <br />
        <br />
        k. is not any commodity or asset that any person is obliged to redeem or purchase;
        <br />
        <br />
        l. is not for speculative investment;
        <br />
        <br />
        m. is not intended to constitute securities in Singapore or any relevant jurisdiction;
        <br />
        <br />
        n. does not result in any mutual covenants, or agreement to rights and obligations, being entered into
        between you and other holders of CETUS inter se; and
        <br />
        <br />
        o. is subject to limitations and conditions in these Terms and all applicable policies as may be published
        from time to time on the Cetus protocol.
        <br />
        <br />
        CETUS does not have any tangible or physical manifestation, and does not have any intrinsic value (nor does
        any Group Entity or any other person make any representation or give any commitment as to its value).
        <br />
        <br />
        You acknowledge and agree that no Group Entity is under any obligation to issue replacement CETUS in the
        event any CETUS or private key is lost, stolen, malfunctioning, destroyed or otherwise inaccessible or
        unusable for any reason.
        <br />
        <br />
        IN PARTICULAR, PLEASE NOTE THAT THE SELLER IS IN THE PROCESS OF UNDERTAKING LEGAL AND REGULATORY ANALYSIS OF
        THE FUNCTIONALITY OF CETUS. FOLLOWING THE CONCLUSION OF THIS ANALYSIS, THERE MAY BE CHANGES TO THE INTENDED
        FUNCTIONALITY OF CETUS IN ORDER TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH ANY LEGAL OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS TO WHICH THE
        SELLER OR CETUS IS SUBJECT. IN THE EVENT OF ANY CHANGES TO THE INTENDED FUNCTIONALITY OF CETUS, THE DETAILS
        OF THE CHANGES SHALL BE PUBLISHED ON THE WEBSITE. IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO REGULARLY CHECK THE WEBSITE
        FOR ANY SUCH NOTICES.
        <br />
        <br />
        These Terms apply to you (“you” or “your”) as a user of our Site, including, without limitation, all the
        products, services, tools and information made available on the Site.
        <br />
        <br />
        <div class="title">2. SCOPE OF TERMS</div>
        <br />
        Unless otherwise stated herein, your purchase of CETUS (whether through an intermediary or otherwise), and
        continued holding and/or usage of CETUS is governed solely by these Terms. New terms or policies may be
        published from time to time on the Cetus protocol at our sole discretion.
        <br />
        <br />
        The sale of CETUS does not constitute the provision of any goods and/or services as at the date that these
        Terms form a binding agreement between the Parties.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Seller shall use reasonable efforts to procure the development of the Cetus protocol in accordance with
        the roadmap as described in the Whitepaper, and shall use reasonable efforts to procure that the Cetus
        protocol remains operational for a period of at least 3 years from the date hereof.
        <br />
        <br />
        Any potential future usage of CETUS in connection with providing or receiving services or the usage of the
        Cetus protocol (when the same is completed and deployed) will be governed primarily by other applicable
        terms and policies (collectively, the Service Terms and Policies), which will be made available on the Cetus
        protocol and/or Website, if the services and the Cetus protocol is successfully completed and deployed. The
        Seller may update these Terms or the Service Terms and Policies in our sole and absolute discretion. It
        shall be your responsibility to regularly check the Cetus protocol / Website for any such notices.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Seller and Group Entities may have economic interests that conflict with yours (or those of your
        affiliates). You agree that nothing in these Terms or any other contractual arrangement between the Parties
        (and/or their affiliates) will be deemed to create an advisory, fiduciary or agency relationship or
        fiduciary or other implied duty between any Group Entity, on the one hand, and you (or your affiliate), on
        the other hand; and that all such relationships are solely contractual in nature. You acknowledge and agree
        that (a) the transactions contemplated by these Terms or any other contractual arrangement between the
        Parties (and/or their affiliates), including any exercise of rights and remedies hereunder and thereunder,
        are arm’s-length commercial transactions between the relevant Group Entity, on the one hand, and you (or
        your affiliate), on the other, and (b) in connection therewith and with the process leading thereto, (i) no
        Group Entity has assumed any advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favour of you (or your affiliate) with
        respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, or the exercise of rights or remedies with respect thereto,
        or the process leading thereto (irrespective of the contractual relationship between the Parties) or any
        other obligation to you or your affiliates, and (ii) each Group Entity is acting solely as principal and not
        as the agent or fiduciary of you, your creditors, or any other person or any affiliates. You acknowledge and
        agree that you have consulted your own legal and financial advisors to the extent you deem appropriate and
        that you are responsible for making your own independent judgment with respect to transactions entered into
        with any Group Entity and the process leading thereto. You agree that you will not claim that any Group
        Entity has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to you,
        in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
        <br />
        <br />
        To the extent of any conflict with these Terms, the updated Terms and the Service Terms and Policies which
        may be published from time to time on the Cetus protocol shall prevail with respect to any issues relating
        to the usage of CETUS in connection with the Cetus protocol.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Seller reserves the right to require you to provide us with your personal details (including without
        limitation full legal name, address and details of the digital wallet from which you have sent the payment),
        and it is your responsibility to provide correct details. Failure to provide this information will prevent
        us from transferring CETUS to your digital wallet.
        <br />
        <br />
        <div class="title">3. CANCELLATION AND REFUSAL AT SELLER'S DISCRETION</div>
        <br />
        Your purchase of CETUS (whether through an intermediary or otherwise) from the Seller is final; there are no
        refunds or cancellations except as may be required by applicable law or regulation and you waive any rights
        to be refunded any amounts which you have paid to the Seller in exchange for CETUS or to cancel any
        purchase.
        <br />
        <br />
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller reserves the right to refuse or cancel any request(s) to purchase
        or purchases of CETUS (as the case may be), at any time in its sole discretion without giving reasons,
        including without limitation the following:
        <br />
        <br />
        a. in connection with any failure to complete know-your-customer, anti-money laundering and counter
        terrorist financing checks prescribed by the Seller;
        <br />
        <br />
        b. in connection with a change of business or development plan of the Seller;
        <br />
        <br />
        c. in connection with an adverse change of the regulatory environment; or
        <br />
        <br />
        d. where the Seller receives, in aggregate, requests to purchase CETUS which exceed the amount of CETUS
        available for the public sale phase, whereupon the Seller shall have the discretion to (i) cancel requests
        to purchase CETUS received after a certain cut-off date/time selected by the Seller, (ii) cancel requests to
        purchase based on certain eligibility criteria selected by the Seller (for example, based on reputation,
        jurisdiction, level of community participation, or purchase amount) (iii) implement pro-rata allocation of
        CETUS based on the respective purchase amount for each buyer, and/or (iv) any combination of the foregoing.
        <br />
        <br />
        For the avoidance of doubt, the Seller shall not be required to notify you of the outcome of any of our
        customer identification, due diligence and/or anti-money laundering due diligence checks, or in any case
        provide reasons for unsatisfactory results of checks. In the event that the Seller refuses or cancels any
        request(s) to purchase CETUS, the price paid by you shall be rejected or refunded (as applicable) in
        accordance with the Seller's internal policies and procedures, less (i) amounts required to be confiscated
        by applicable laws, (ii) fees and expenses incurred in connection with the marketing and/or development of
        the Cetus protocol, (iii) blockchain network fees and the Seller's administrative fees for processing such
        transfer (not exceeding 5% of the refund amount), and (iv) the same proportion of purchased CETUS already
        made available to you for claiming. The Seller reserves the right to require you to provide the Seller with
        your personal details (including without limitation correct name, address and details of the digital wallet
        from which you have sent the payment), and it is your responsibility to provide correct details. Failure to
        provide this information will prevent the Seller from allocating the token to your digital wallet. No
        interest will accrue on the value of any refund.
        <br />
        <br />
        At any time during the sale of CETUS, the Seller may either temporarily suspend or permanently abort the
        token sale (whether relating to the private sale or public sale phase, or both) at its sole discretion
        without providing any reasons whatsoever. During any period of suspension or in the event that the token
        sale is aborted (whether relating to the private sale or public sale phase, or both), CETUS will not be
        available for purchase.
        <br />
        <br />
        <div class="title">4. ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND ASSUMPTION OF RISKS</div>
        <br />
        You acknowledge and agree that there are numerous risks associated with purchasing CETUS, holding CETUS, and
        using CETUS for participation in the Cetus protocol. If you have any queries or require any clarification
        regarding these risks, please contact us at hello@cetus.zone.
        <br />
        <br />
        YOU CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THAT BLOCKCHAIN AND VIRTUAL CURRENCIES / TOKENS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION CETUS
        OR SUI TOKEN, ARE NEW AND UNVERIFIED TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE BEYOND CONTROL OF ANY GROUP ENTITY. IN
        PARTICULAR, AND IN ADDITION TO TERMS OF THIS DOCUMENT, YOU BEAR FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RISKS DESIGNATED
        IN THE PROPOSED DOCUMENTATION. BY PURCHASING (WHETHER THROUGH AN INTERMEDIARY OR OTHERWISE), HOLDING AND/OR
        USING CETUS, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND ASSUME THE FOLLOWING RISKS:
        <br />
        <br />
        a. Risk of changes in functionality
        <br />
        <br />
        CETUS does not have any rights, uses, purpose, attributes, functionalities or features, express or implied,
        except for those which are specifically described in the White Paper and which may change from time to time.
        <br />
        <br />
        b. CETUS is non-refundable
        <br />
        <br />
        The Seller is not obliged to provide CETUS holders with a refund related to CETUS for any reason, and CETUS
        holders acknowledge and agree that they will not receive money or other compensation in lieu of a refund. No
        promises of future performance or price are or will be made in respect to CETUS, including no promise of
        inherent value, no promise of continuing payments, and no guarantee that CETUS will hold any particular
        value. Therefore, the recovery of spent resources may be impossible or may be subject to foreign laws or
        regulations, which may not be the same as the laws in the jurisdiction of CETUS.
        <br />
        <br />
        c. Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions
        <br />
        <br />
        The regulatory status of CETUS and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many
        jurisdictions, but numerous regulatory authorities across jurisdictions have been outspoken about
        considering the implementation of regulatory regimes which govern virtual currencies or virtual currency
        markets. It is impossible to predict how, when or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulations
        or create new regulations with respect to such technology and its applications, including CETUS and/or the
        Cetus protocol. Regulatory actions could negatively impact CETUS and/or the Cetus protocol in various ways.
        The Seller or any Group Entity may cease operations in a jurisdiction, or even abandon certain features of
        the project, in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to
        operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to
        operate in such jurisdiction.
        <br />
        <br />
        d. Risks associated with the Blockchain Protocol
        <br />
        <br />
        Given that CETUS and the Cetus protocol are based on blockchain protocol and architecture, any malfunction,
        breakdown or abandonment of the relevant blockchain protocol or architecture may have a material adverse
        effect on CETUS and/or the Cetus protocol. Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical advances
        (including without limitation development of quantum computing), could present unknown risks to CETUS and/or
        the Cetus protocol by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins that
        blockchain protocol. The future of cryptography and security innovations are highly unpredictable. Further,
        products or services available on the Cetus protocol may require digital assets provided by a user to be
        deposited with, "staked" with and/or otherwise require interaction with various third party decentralised
        finance protocols which primarily comprise smart contracts deployed on the relevant blockchain. These third
        party decentralised finance protocols and the development team behind these protocols are independent third
        parties, so no Group Entity has control over these protocols or teams. The deployed smart contracts
        underlying the Cetus protocol or these decentralised finance protocols are highly experimental in nature,
        risky, and may contain security vulnerabilities, errors, failures, bugs or economic loopholes which may be
        exploited by third parties, causing you to suffer losses in connection with any product(s) available on the
        Cetus protocol. Neither the Seller nor any Group Entity can be responsible for any such security
        vulnerabilities, errors, failures, bugs or economic loopholes.
        <br />
        <br />
        e. Security
        <br />
        <br />
        You are responsible for implementing reasonable measures for securing the digital wallet, vault or other
        storage mechanism you use to receive and hold CETUS which you have purchased, including any requisite
        passwords, tokens, private key(s) or other credentials necessary to access such storage mechanism(s). If
        your passwords, tokens, private key(s) or other access credentials are lost, you may lose access to your
        CETUS. The Seller cannot be responsible for, and is technologically unable to recover, any such losses.
        <br />
        <br />
        f. Insufficient Information
        <br />
        <br />
        The Cetus protocol is at the stage of development as of the date of these Terms and its algorithm, code,
        consensus mechanism and/or various other technical specifications and parameters could be updated and
        changed frequently and constantly. While the marketing materials and Whitepaper released relating to the
        development of the Cetus protocol has been prepared with the then up-to-date key information of the Cetus
        protocol, it is not absolutely complete and is subject to adjustments and updates from time to time for
        optimal development and growth of the Cetus protocol and/or ecosystem on the Cetus protocol. The Seller is
        neither able, nor obliged, to keep you closely posted on every detail of the development of the Cetus
        protocol (including its progress and expected milestones no matter whether rescheduled or not) and therefore
        will not necessarily provide you with timely and full access to all the information relating to the Cetus
        protocol that may emerge from time to time. Due to the nature of the project to develop the Cetus protocol,
        you accept that such insufficiency of information disclosure is inevitable and reasonable.
        <br />
        <br />
        g. Security weaknesses.
        <br />
        <br />
        Hackers or other malicious groups or organisations may attempt to interfere with CETUS and/or the Cetus
        protocol in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks,
        consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, there is a risk that a third
        party or a member of any Group Entity may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the
        core infrastructure of CETUS and/or the Cetus protocol, which could negatively affect CETUS and/or the Cetus
        protocol.
        <br />
        <br />
        h. Risks associated with a lack of markets for CETUS
        <br />
        <br />
        There is no prior market for CETUS and the CETUS sale may not result in an active or liquid market for
        CETUS. CETUS is intended to be used solely within the network for the Cetus protocol, hence there may be
        illiquidity risk with respect to any CETUS you hold.
        <br />
        <br />
        CETUS is not a currency issued by any central bank or national, supra-national or quasi-national
        organisation, nor is it backed by any hard assets or other credit nor is it a "commodity" in the usual and
        traditional sense of that word. The Seller cannot be responsible for, nor does the Seller pursue, the
        circulation and trading of CETUS on any market. Trading of CETUS will merely depend on the consensus on its
        value between the relevant market participants. No one is obliged to purchase any CETUS from any holder of
        CETUS, including the purchasers, nor does anyone guarantee the liquidity or market price of CETUS to any
        extent at any time. Furthermore, CETUS may not be resold to a purchaser who is a citizen, national, resident
        (tax or otherwise), domiciliary or green card holder of a Restricted Country or to purchasers where the
        purchase of CETUS may be in violation of applicable laws. Accordingly, the Seller cannot ensure that there
        will be any demand or market for CETUS, or that the price you pay for CETUS is indicative of any market
        valuation or market price for CETUS.
        <br />
        <br />
        Any secondary market or exchange for trading CETUS would be run and operated wholly independently of the
        Group Entities, the sale of CETUS and the Cetus protocol. No Group Entity will create such secondary markets
        nor will it act as an exchange for CETUS. Even if secondary trading of CETUS is facilitated by third party
        exchanges, such exchanges may be relatively new and subject to little or no regulatory oversight, making
        them more susceptible to fraud or manipulation. Furthermore, to the extent that third parties do ascribe an
        external exchange value to CETUS (e.g., as denominated in a virtual or fiat currency), such value may be
        extremely volatile, decline below the price which a holder had paid for CETUS, and/or even diminish to zero.
        Holders of CETUS shall be responsible for all losses in connection with the purchase of or secondary trading
        of CETUS, and shall not make any claim against any Group Entity in connection with the same.
        <br />
        <br />
        i. Risk of Uninsured Losses
        <br />
        <br />
        CETUS is uninsured unless you specifically obtain private insurance to insure them. In the event of loss or
        loss of utility value, there is no public insurer or private insurance arranged by any Group Entity to offer
        recourse to you.
        <br />
        <br />
        j. Taxation risks
        <br />
        <br />
        The tax characterisation of CETUS is uncertain. The tax characterisation of CETUS and these Terms is
        uncertain. The Seller intends to treat CETUS and these Terms neither as an equity interest nor as a debt
        interest in the Seller for tax purposes. It is possible that the Seller’s intended treatment of CETUS and
        these Terms may be challenged, so that the tax consequences to a purchaser and the Seller relating to CETUS
        and these Terms could differ from those described above. You must seek your own tax advice in connection
        with the purchase, holding and/or usage of CETUS, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you,
        including withholding taxes, income taxes and tax reporting requirements.
        <br />
        <br />
        k. Competitors
        <br />
        <br />
        It is possible that alternative networks could be established that utilise the same or similar code and
        protocol underlying CETUS and/or the Cetus protocol and attempt to re-create similar facilities. The Cetus
        protocol may be required to compete with these alternative networks, which could negatively impact CETUS
        and/or the Cetus protocol.
        <br />
        <br />
        l. Insufficient Interest
        <br />
        <br />
        It is possible that the Cetus protocol will not be used by a large number of individuals, companies and
        other entities or that there will be limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed
        ecosystems (such as the Cetus protocol). Such a lack of use or interest could negatively impact the
        development of the Cetus protocol and therefore the potential utility of CETUS.
        <br />
        <br />
        m.Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure
        <br />
        <br />
        The legal structure for the Group Entities (including the intra-Group arrangements) is bespoke and there is
        no generally accepted standard or structure for similar projects in the distributed ledger technology space.
        The legal structure had been designed to address certain specific legal risks, and attempt to decentralise
        the management and control, as well as economic risks and benefits relating to the Cetus protocol and CETUS;
        but there is no legal precedent for whether these structures are effective and it is difficult to predict
        the position that a regulator may adopt. The legal structure and contractual arrangements may not be
        effective in decentralising management and control, thereby adversely affecting the value of the Cetus
        protocol and/or CETUS.
        <br />
        <br />
        n. Risk of Dissolution of the Seller, any Group Entity or the Cetus protocol
        <br />
        <br />
        Start-up companies such as the Seller involve a high degree of risk. Financial and operating risks
        confronting start-up companies are significant, and the Seller is not immune to these. Start-up companies
        often experience unexpected problems in the areas of product development, marketing, financing, and general
        management, among others, which frequently cannot be solved.
        <br />
        <br />
        It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, an unfavourable
        fluctuation in the value of virtual and/or fiat currencies, decrease in the utility of CETUS due to negative
        adoption of the Cetus protocol, the failure of commercial relationships, or intellectual property ownership
        challenges, the Cetus protocol may no longer be viable to operate and the Seller or any Group Entity may be
        dissolved.
        <br />
        <br />
        o. Risks Arising from Lack of Governance Rights
        <br />
        <br />
        Because CETUS confers no governance rights of any kind with respect to the Cetus protocol or any Group
        Entity, all decisions involving the Cetus protocol or any Group Entity will be made by the relevant Group
        Entity at its sole and absolute discretion, including, but not limited to, decisions to discontinue the
        services and/or ecosystem on the Cetus protocol, to create and sell more CETUS for use in the ecosystem on
        the Cetus protocol, or to sell or liquidate any Group Entity. These decisions could adversely affect the
        Cetus protocol and CETUS you hold.
        <br />
        <br />
        p. Loss of Talent
        <br />
        <br />
        The development of the Cetus protocol depends on the continued co-operation of the existing technical team
        and expert consultants, who are highly knowledgeable and experienced in their respective sectors. The loss
        of any member may adversely affect the Cetus protocol or its future development. Further, stability and
        cohesion within the team is critical to the overall development of the Cetus protocol. There is the
        possibility that conflict within the team and/or departure of core personnel may occur, resulting in
        negative influence on the project in the future.
        <br />
        <br />
        q. Failure to develop
        <br />
        <br />
        There is the risk that the development of the Cetus protocol will not be executed or implemented as planned,
        for a variety of reasons, including without limitation the event of a decline in the prices of any digital
        asset, virtual currency or CETUS, unforeseen technical difficulties, shortage of development funds for
        activities, and/or losses in connection with the acts or omissions of any third party (including without
        limitation failure of financial institutions, cryptocurrency exchanges, wallet providers or blockchain
        protocols).
        <br />
        <br />
        r. Forking
        <br />
        <br />
        The Cetus protocol is a community project and certain elements are open-sourced. The Seller (nor any Group
        Entity) does not and cannot monopolise the development, marketing, operation or otherwise of the Cetus
        protocol. Any entity may independently develop a patch or upgrade of the source code of the Cetus protocol
        or blockchain without prior authorisation of any other party. The acceptance of these patches or upgrades by
        a sufficient (not necessarily overwhelming) percentage of CETUS holders could result in a “fork” in the
        blockchain, and consequently two diverging networks will emerge and remain. Each branch of the blockchain
        arising from the fork will have its own native cryptographic tokens – accordingly there will be two
        different versions of CETUS respectively residing in the two divergent branches with almost identical
        technical features and functions. The community on the Cetus protocol may split into two groups in support
        of the two branches respectively.
        <br />
        <br />
        Further, it is theoretically possible for each branch of the forked blockchain to be further forked an
        unlimited number of times. The temporary or permanent existence of forked blockchains could adversely affect
        the operation of the Cetus protocol and blockchain and the CETUS which you hold, and may ruin the
        sustainability of the Cetus protocol.
        <br />
        <br />
        s. Other risks
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition to the aforementioned risks, there are other risks associated with your purchase, holding and
        usage of CETUS, including those that the Seller cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialise as
        unanticipated variations or combinations of the aforementioned risks.
        <br />
        <br />
        <div class="title">5. KNOW YOUR CLIENT REGULATIONS AND PERSONAL DATA</div>
        <br />
        Know your client regulations
        <br />
        <br />
        You hereby acknowledge and accept that:
        <br />
        <br />
        a. The Seller may be required to conduct customer identification, due diligence and anti-money laundering
        due diligence on all purchasers of CETUS in compliance with all applicable laws and legislations. The Seller
        may determine, in its sole discretion, that it is necessary to obtain certain information about you in order
        to comply with these laws and legislations. You agree to provide such information to the Seller promptly
        upon request, and you acknowledge that the Seller may refuse to sell CETUS to you until you provide such
        requested information and the Seller has determined that it is permissible to sell you CETUS under
        applicable law or regulation.
        <br />
        <br />
        b. The Seller may at any point in time request information and/or documentation to establish that its
        identification records, as well as the information that form your profile, remain completely updated. In
        this respect, the Seller reserves the right to examine and check on a regular basis the validity and
        adequacy of your identification data and information maintained. For the avoidance of doubt, the Seller
        shall not be required to notify you of the outcome of any of its customer identification, due diligence
        and/or anti-money laundering due diligence checks, or in any case provide reasons for unsatisfactory results
        of checks.
        <br />
        <br />
        c. If at any time the Seller becomes aware that reliable or adequate data and information are missing from
        your identity, the Seller reserves the right to take all necessary actions to collect the missing data and
        information (whether from you or from third parties) so as to update and complete your profile as necessary.
        <br />
        <br />
        d. If you fail or refuse to submit, within a reasonable timeframe, the required data and identification
        information for the updating of your identity and, as a consequence, the Seller is unable to comply with any
        laws, legislations regulations or directives relating to customer identification requirements, the Seller
        will not be able to sell CETUS and/or continue its relationship with you, and the Seller may be required to
        submit a report of suspicious transactions/activities to the relevant authorities.
        <br />
        <br />
        <div class="title">Personal Data</div>
        <br />
        <br />
        i. The Seller (and its affiliates) will collect, use, process and disclose your information and personal
        data for providing its services and discharging of its legal duties and responsibilities, administration,
        customer services, crime (including tax evasion) prevention and detection, anti-money laundering, due
        diligence and verification of identity purposes (collectively, the Purposes). The Seller may disclose your
        information to its service providers, agents, relevant custodians or similar third parties for these
        Purposes. The Seller may keep your information for such period as it may determine (which shall be no
        shorter than any mandatory period prescribed by law) to contact you about the Cetus protocol. You hereby
        consent to the Seller transferring your personal data to its affiliates or service providers for processing,
        and to recipients in countries which do not provide the same level of data protection as your jurisdiction
        if necessary for the Purposes.
        <br />
        <br />
        ii. If you withdraw your consent to any or all use of your personal data, depending on the nature of your
        request, this may limit the scope of our services which the Seller is able to provide to you. Please contact
        us at hello@cetus.zone (marking your email for the attention of “Data Protection Officer”). The Seller will
        endeavour to respond to your query / request within 30 days, and if that is not possible, the Seller will
        inform you of the time by which it will respond to you.
        <br />
        <br />
        iii. You hereby warrant, represent and confirm to us and shall procure that with respect to any personal
        data of any individual (including, where applicable, your directors, partners, office holders, officers,
        employees, agents, shareholders and beneficial owners) (each, an Individual) disclosed to us in connection
        with these Terms, the Service Terms and Policies and/or the CETUS sale or otherwise collected by us in the
        course of your relationship with us or any of our affiliates:
        <br />
        <br />
        (1) each Individual to whom the personal data relates has, prior to such disclosure or collection, agreed
        and consented to, and permitted you on its behalf to consent to, such disclosure as well as the collection,
        processing, use and disclosure of the Individual’s personal data by us for all purposes required by us in
        connection with these Terms and/or the CETUS sale;
        <br />
        <br />
        (2) that each Individual has read and consented to the collection, processing, use and disclosure of the
        Individual’s personal data by us in accordance with the Purpose; and
        <br />
        <br />
        (3) any consent given pursuant to these Terms in relation to each Individual’s personal data shall survive
        death, incapacity, bankruptcy or insolvency of that Individual and the termination or expiration of these
        Terms and the Service Terms and Policies.
        <br />
        <br />
        iv. If any Individual should withdraw his/her consent to any or all use of his/her personal data, then
        depending on the nature of the withdrawal request, the Seller may not be in a position to continue its
        relationship with you and/or sell CETUS, and the Seller shall be entitled to its rights under these Terms
        and the Service Terms and Policies (without prejudice to our other rights and remedies at law against you).
        <br />
        <br />
        <div class="title">6. TAXES</div>
        <br />
        The price that you pay for CETUS is exclusive of all applicable taxes (including without limitation
        obligations to pay value added, sales, use, offerings, withholding taxes, income or similar taxes) (Taxes).
        The onus for determining the Taxes applicable to your purchase, holding and/or usage of CETUS lies solely
        with you. It is also your sole responsibility to comply with all relevant tax reporting requirements arising
        out of or in connection with your purchase, holding and/or usage of CETUS. The Seller is not responsible for
        withholding, collecting, reporting, or remitting any Taxes arising from your purchase, holding and/or usage
        of CETUS. The Seller cannot and does not provide any tax advice and it recommends that you seek appropriate
        professional advice in this area if required.
        <br />
        <br />
        <div class="title">7. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES</div>
        <br />
        <br />
        By purchasing (whether through an intermediary or otherwise), holding and/or using CETUS, you represent and
        warrant that:
        <br />
        <br />
        a. You have read and understand these Terms and the Whitepaper, and you have all requisite power and
        authority to execute and deliver these Terms, to participate in the CETUS sale, to purchase, hold and/or use
        CETUS, and to carry out and perform your obligations under these terms.
        <br />
        <br />
        b. If you are an individual, you are at least 21 years old and in any case of sufficient legal age and
        capacity to purchase, hold and/or use CETUS. If you are a legal person, you are duly organised, validly
        existing and in good standing under the laws of your domicile and each jurisdiction where you conduct
        business or where your assets are located. You are not purchasing, holding and/or using CETUS on behalf of
        any other entity or person.
        <br />
        <br />
        c. The execution, delivery and performance of these Terms will not result in any violation of, be in
        conflict with, or constitute a default under, with or without the passage of time or the giving of notice:
        (i) any provision of your constitutional documents (if applicable), (ii) any provision of any judgment,
        decree or order, or any agreement, obligation, duty or commitment to which you are a party, or by which you
        are bound, or to which any of its material assets are subject, (iii) any laws, regulations or rules
        applicable to you, (iv) any foreign exchange or regulatory restrictions applicable to such purchase, holding
        and/or usage of CETUS, or (v) any governmental or other consents that may need to be obtained.
        <br />
        <br />
        d. The execution and delivery of, and performance under, these Terms require no approval or other action
        from any governmental authority or person. You will and shall at your own expense ensure compliance with all
        laws, regulatory requirements and restrictions applicable to you (as the case may be).
        <br />
        <br />
        e. Your purchase of CETUS shall be made in full compliance with any applicable tax obligations to which you
        may be subject in any relevant jurisdiction. You understand that you bear the sole responsibility to
        determine if your use of the Cetus protocol, the transfer of any virtual currency to the Seller, the
        creation, ownership or use of CETUS, the potential appreciation or depreciation in the value of CETUS over
        time, the sale and purchase of CETUS and/or any other action or transaction related to the Seller or the
        Cetus protocol have tax implications (including determining what taxes may apply to the acquisition,
        possession, storage, sale or other use of CETUS including, for example, sales, use, value-added and similar
        taxes and for complying with any obligations to withhold, collect, report and remit the correct taxes to the
        appropriate tax authorities in relation to its acquisition, possession, storage, sale or other use of
        CETUS); by creating, holding or using CETUS, and to the extent permitted by law, you agree not to hold any
        third party (including developers, auditors, contractors or founders) liable for any tax liability
        associated with or arising from the creation, ownership or use of CETUS or any other action or transaction
        related to the Seller (or any Group Entity) or the Cetus protocol.
        <br />
        <br />
        f. You have good and sufficient understanding in business and financial matters, including a good and
        sufficient understanding of the functionality, usage, storage, transmission mechanisms and other material
        characteristics of blockchain technology, blockchain-like technology, blockchain-based software systems as
        well as other similar technologies and systems, cryptographic tokens, and token storage mechanisms (such as
        digital token wallets) to understand these Terms and to appreciate the risks and implications of purchasing,
        holding and/or usage of CETUS.
        <br />
        <br />
        g. You have obtained sufficient information about CETUS to make an informed decision to purchase, hold
        and/or use CETUS. Additionally, you are aware of the Seller’s business affairs and financial condition and
        have obtained sufficient information about the Seller to reach an informed decision to purchase CETUS.
        <br />
        <br />
        h. The currency (including any fiat, digital currency, virtual currency or cryptocurrency) used to purchase
        CETUS are obtained through lawful means, and are not derived from or related to any unlawful activities,
        including but not limited to money laundering or terrorist financing and all applicable statutes of all
        jurisdictions in which you are located, resident, organised or operating, and/or to which it may otherwise
        be subject and the rules and regulations thereunder (collectively, the Compliance Regulations), and you will
        not use CETUS to finance, engage in, or otherwise support any unlawful activities or in a manner which aids
        or facilitates another party in the same. To the extent required by applicable laws and regulations, you
        shall fully comply with all Compliance Regulations and no action, suit or proceeding by or before any court
        or governmental agency, authority or body or any arbitrator involving it or any of your affiliates with
        respect to the Compliance Regulations is pending or, to the best of your knowledge (after due and careful
        enquiry), threatened.

        product (including without limitation the United States of America and the People's Republic of China (the
        Restricted Countries).
        <br />
        <br />

        jurisdiction in which you are based and that acquiring CETUS (through purchase or otherwise) in that
        jurisdiction is not prohibited, restricted or subject to additional conditions of any kind, (ii) no
        regulatory authority has examined or approved of the information set out in the Whitepaper or any other

        by you, is not prohibited or restricted by the applicable laws, regulations, or rules in your jurisdiction,
        and where any restrictions in relation to possession are applicable, you will observe and comply with all
        such restrictions at your own expense and risk without liability to the Seller, (v) you shall ensure that no
        obligations are imposed on the Seller in any such jurisdiction as a result of any of the actions taken by
        you in the preceding sub-clause, and (vi) the Seller will have no responsibility for and it will not obtain
        any consent, approval or permission required by you for, the acquisition, offer, sale or offering to you of

        which you use CETUS.
        <br />
        <br />
        m. You are a highly sophisticated and experienced party that acknowledges and understands that (i) the
        Seller, the Group Entities and their respective affiliates may possess material information regarding the
        Cetus protocol and CETUS that is not publicly available and has not been made available to you, which
        information may impact the value of CETUS or the use on the Cetus protocol, and that Seller is not
        disclosing such information to you, (ii) due to legal uncertainty, CETUS may be deemed to be securities or
        financial instruments under applicable laws. Notwithstanding any disparity in information or legal
        uncertainty, you have agreed to enter into these Terms and consummate the transactions hereunder and hereby
        agree not to bring any claim against the Seller, the Group Entities or any of their respective affiliates in
        respect thereof and, as a sophisticated party with extensive experience in token purchase transactions,
        hereby waive any claims or causes of action in respect thereof.
        <br />
        <br />
        n. The currency (whether fiat or virtual) used in the purchase of CETUS will be made only in your name, from
        a digital wallet not located in a country or territory that has been designated as a “non-cooperative
        country or territory” by the Financial Action Task Force or any similar legislation.
        <br />
        <br />
        o. You are purchasing, holding and/or using CETUS to participate in the Cetus protocol, as well as to
        support the advancement, promotion, research, design and development of, and advocacy for the Cetus
        protocol, as well as potentially receiving services on the Cetus protocol (when the same is completed and
        deployed). You are not purchasing, holding or using CETUS for any other uses or purposes, including, but not
        limited to, any investment, speculative or other financial purposes.
        <br />
        <br />
        p. You acknowledge that: (i) CETUS does not have any intrinsic value and that it may never recover any cash,
        cryptocurrency or other assets which are used directly or indirectly to acquire CETUS; (ii) there is no
        market-standard valuation process to determine the value of CETUS at any given time; and (iii) the Seller
        gives no guarantees whatsoever on the value of CETUS which may be highly volatile and could reduce to zero.
        <br />
        <br />
        q. You acknowledge and agree that the Seller may impose eligibility criteria to access certain functionality
        in respect of CETUS which may require it to incur additional time and money costs.
        <br />
        <br />
        r. You shall not sell or transfer or agree to sell to transfer (whether pursuant to any public pool or
        private agreement with a subsequent purchaser or otherwise) any CETUS prior to the completion of the public
        sale of CETUS.
        <br />
        <br />
        s. You shall not sell or transfer any CETUS prior to procuring the purchaser's or transferee's agreement to
        these Terms.
        <br />
        <br />
        t. You acknowledge that the currency (whether fiat or virtual) paid to us for the purchase of CETUS will be
        held by us (or our affiliate) after the token sale, and you will have no economic or legal right over or
        beneficial interest in these contributions or the assets of that entity after the token sale.
        <br />
        <br />
        u. You acknowledge and undertake that you shall provide the Seller with such information as the Seller may
        deem necessary or appropriate in order to maintain compliance with applicable law including: (i) compliance
        with the representations set out in this Clause 7, and (ii) to address any actual inquiries or inquiries
        that the Seller may (at its sole discretion) expect from regulatory authorities, courts or arbitral
        authorities in any jurisdiction.
        <br />
        <br />
        v. You hereby acknowledge and agree that the Seller may have to procure an amendment to the functionality of
        CETUS at any time in order to facilitate compliance with any legal or regulatory issues which may arise or
        shall be anticipated, including: (i) any actual action taken, or potential action that the Seller (in its
        sole discretion) expects to be taken, by a court or regulatory authority in any jurisdiction in relation to
        the use of CETUS and all related matters, and (ii) any additional legal or regulatory risk mitigation in
        respect of the functionality of CETUS that the Seller decides to undertake at any time.
        <br />
        <br />
        You hereby acknowledge that the Seller has entered into these Terms in reliance upon your representations
        and warranties being true, accurate, complete and non-misleading. The Seller does not and does not purport
        to make, and hereby disclaims, all representations, warranties or undertaking to you in relation to the sale
        of CETUS or otherwise. Prospective purchasers of CETUS should carefully consider and evaluate all risks and
        uncertainties (including financial and legal risks and uncertainties) associated with the CETUS sale, the
        Seller, and any relevant Group Entity.
        <br />
        <br />
        <div class="title">8. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</div>
        <br />

        from, such rights and all similar or equivalent rights or forms of protection which subsist or will subsist
        now or in the future in any part of the world. You may not use any of the Seller’s (or the relevant Group
        Entity's) intellectual property for any reason whatsoever.
        <br />
        <br />
        <div class="title">9. INDEMNITY</div>
        <br />
        To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you will, as a separate and independent obligation,
        indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller, each Group Entity, and their respective past, present and
        future employees, officers, directors, contractors, consultants, equity holders, suppliers, vendors, service

        <br />
        <br />
        <div class="title">10. RELEASE</div>
        <br />
        To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you release the Seller and the other Indemnified Parties
        from responsibility, liability, claims, demands and/or damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and
        nature, known and unknown (including, but not limited to, claims of negligence), arising out of or related
        to disputes between users and the acts or omissions of third parties. You expressly waive any rights you may
        have under any statute or common law principles that would otherwise limit the coverage of this release to
        include only those claims which you may know or suspect to exist in your favour at the time of agreeing to
        this release.
        <br />
        <br />
        <div class="title">11. GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION</div>
        <br />
        These Terms will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Singapore, without
        regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of Singapore or any other jurisdiction) that would
        cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any dispute arising out of or in connection
        with these Terms or any of the transactions contemplated in connection with the same (including without
        limitation the enforceability of this arbitration Clause, any question regarding existence, validity or
        termination) shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered by the Singapore
        International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore
        International Arbitration Centre (SIAC Rules) for the time being in force, which rules are deemed to be
        incorporated by reference in this arbitration Clause. The seat of the arbitration shall be Singapore. The
        Tribunal shall consist of 1 arbitrator. The language of the arbitration shall be English.
        <br />
        <br />
        Any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms is personal to the user and the Seller, and will be
        resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action
        or any other type of representative proceeding. There will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which
        an individual attempts to resolve a dispute as a representative of another individual or group of
        individuals. For avoidance of doubt, it is made clear that any dispute that may arise cannot be brought as a
        class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any
        other individual or group of individuals.
        <br />
        <br />
        The arbitrator appointed under this Clause 11 shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving
        the Seller, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same user to the extent required by
        applicable law. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the
        arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. This Clause 11 shall not preclude the
        Seller from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
        Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, you agree that the Seller may initiate a proceeding related to the
        enforcement or validity of its intellectual property rights in any court having jurisdiction.
        <br />
        <br />
        Each Party agrees to keep all matters relating to this arbitration, including the arbitral awards,
        confidential, except as is otherwise required by court order or as is necessary to confirm, set aside or
        enforce the arbitral award and for disclosure in confidence to each Party’s respective legal, financial or
        other professional advisors.
        <br />
        <br />
        <div class="title"> 12. PARTIAL INVALIDITY</div>
        <br />
        If, at any time, any provision of these Terms is or becomes illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any respect
        under any law of any jurisdiction, neither the legality, validity or enforceability of the remaining
        provisions nor the legality, validity or enforceability of such provision under the law of any other
        jurisdiction will in any way be affected or impaired.
        <br />

        b. you are not entitled to any refund of any amount paid whatsoever, save in the case where these Terms are

        c. Clauses 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, 17, 18 and 19 will survive and continue to apply in accordance with their
        terms to you in respect of any CETUS held, together with any of your obligation(s), or required performance
        under these Terms which, by its express terms or nature and context is intended to survive expiration or
        termination of these Terms.
        <br />
        <br />
        <div class="title">14. ENTIRE AGREEMENT</div>

        required to comply with applicable law or regulation. If the Seller makes changes, it will as soon as
        practicable post the amended Terms at the Website. The amended Terms will be effective immediately. It is
        your responsibility to regularly check the Website for any such amendments.

        You shall under no circumstances be entitled to assign or novate your rights and obligations under these
        Terms (including without limitation the right to claim any CETUS purchased). The Seller may assign or novate
        its rights and obligations under these Terms without your consent, and you agree to, at your own expense,
        take whatever action or execute any document which the Seller may require for the purpose of effecting any
        such assignment or novation by the Seller.
        <br />
        <br />
        <div class="title">16. REMEDIES AND WAIVERS</div>
        <br />
        No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on our part, any right or remedy under these Terms
        Documents shall operate as a waiver, of any such right or remedy or constitute an election to affirm these
        Terms. No election to affirm these Terms on our part shall be effective unless it is in writing. No single
        or partial exercise of any right or remedy prevents any further or other exercise or the exercise of any
        other right or remedy. The rights and remedies provided in these Terms are cumulative and not exclusive of
        any rights or remedies provided by law.
        <br />
        <br />
        <div class="title">17. DISCLAIMERS</div>
        <br />
        a. You expressly acknowledge, understand and agree that you are purchasing (whether through an intermediary
        or otherwise), holding and/or using CETUS at your sole risk and discretion, and that CETUS is provided, used
        and purchased on an “AS IS” and on an “AS AVAILABLE” basis without any representations, warranties, promises
        or guarantees whatsoever of any kind by the Seller or any Group Entity. Prior to making any decision to
        purchase (whether through an intermediary or otherwise), hold and/or use CETUS, you shall conduct your own
        due diligence and rely only on your own examination and investigation thereof.
        <br />
        <br />
        b. Changes in relevant laws and regulations in any jurisdictions which the Seller is operating shall
        constitute a force majeure and the Seller will not be responsible for any result arising out of such changes
        in relevant laws and regulations.
        <br />
        <br />
        c. The Seller does not make and expressly disclaims all representations and warranties, express, implied or
        statutory; and with respect to CETUS, the Seller specifically does not represent and warrant and expressly
        disclaims any representation or warranty, express, implied or statutory, including without limitation, any
        representations or warranties of title, non-infringement, merchantability, usage, suitability or fitness for
        any particular purpose, or as to the workmanship or technical coding thereof, or the absence of any defects
        therein, whether latent or patent. In addition, the Seller cannot and does not represent or warrant that
        CETUS or the claim/delivery mechanism for CETUS are free of security vulnerabilities, viruses, errors,
        failures, bugs or loopholes which may be exploited by third parties, or other harmful components.
        <br />
        <br />
        d. The Seller assumes that you have already read these Terms, especially the risks and disclaimer stated
        herein and hereunder, and you shall automatically be regarded agree to take all risks (including but not

        <div class="title">18. INDEMNIFIED PARTIES NOT LIABLE</div>
        <br />
        CETUS is not being structured or sold as securities or any other form of investment product. Accordingly,
        none of the information presented in these Terms is intended to form the basis for any investment decision,
        and no specific recommendations are intended. Save in the case of fraud or gross negligence, the Indemnified
        Parties (including Cetus protocol project contributors) expressly disclaim any and all responsibility for
        any direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential or exemplary loss or damage of any kind whatsoever
        arising directly or indirectly (including without limitation, those relating to loss of revenue, income or
        profits, loss of use or data, or damages for business interruption) in connection with:
        <br />
        <br />
        a. reliance on any information contained in these terms;
        b. any error, omission or inaccuracy in any such information;
        c. any action resulting from such information; or
        d. the sale or usage of CETUS.
        <br />
        <br />
        In no event will the aggregate liability of the Indemnified Parties (including the Cetus protocol project
        contributors), jointly, whether in contract, warranty, tort, or other theory, arising out of or relating to
        these terms or the usage of or inability to use CETUS, exceed the amount you pay to us for CETUS.
        <br />
        <br />
        <div class="title">19. CLAIMS</div>
        <br />
        The Seller shall not be liable in any way or in any event in respect of any claim under these Terms if such
        claim was not made within the 6-month period commencing from the date that you receive CETUS (the Claim
        Period). Any claim which has been made before the expiration of the Claim Period shall, if it has not been
        previously satisfied in full, settled or withdrawn, be deemed to have been withdrawn and shall become fully
        barred and unenforceable on the expiry of the period of six (6) months commencing from the date on which
        such claim was made, unless proceedings in respect thereof shall have been commenced against the Seller and
        for this purpose proceedings shall not be deemed to have been commenced unless they shall have been issued
        and served upon the Seller.
        <br />
        <br />
        For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in these Terms shall limit your obligation (at law or otherwise) to
        mitigate your loss in respect of any claim under these Terms, and you shall not be entitled to recover
        damages in respect of any claim (as the case may be) if, and to the extent that, you have already recovered
        damages in respect of the same fact or subject matter.
        <br />
        <br />
        <div class="title">20. PARTNERSHIP</div>
        <br />
        Purchasing (whether through an intermediary or otherwise), holding and/or using CETUS does not create any
        form of partnership, joint venture or any other similar relationship between you and us, nor cause the
        Parties to be deemed acting in concert in any respect.
        <br />
        <br />
        <div class="title">21. CONFIDENTIALITY</div>
        <br />
        You shall hold, and shall cause your affiliates, officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel,
        consultants, advisors and agents to hold, in confidence all documents, information and correspondence
        concerning CETUS or any Group Entity furnished to you or your affiliates in connection with the transactions
        contemplated by these Terms or any pre-contractual or post-contractual negotiations in connection therewith
        (including without limitation all commercial information such as sale price, number of tokens sold, discount
        (if any), as well as schedule for claim/delivery of tokens), except to the extent that such information can
        be shown to have been (a) previously known on a non-confidential basis by you, (b) in the public domain
        disclosed without any fault on your part or (c) later lawfully acquired by you from sources other than any
        Group Entity. If these Terms are terminated, you shall, and shall cause your affiliates, officers,
        directors, employees, accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors and agents to, destroy or deliver to the
        Seller, upon request, all documents and other materials, and all copies thereof, obtained by you or your
        affiliates in connection with these Terms that are subject to such confidence.
        <br />
        <br />
        <div class="title">22. RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES</div>
        <br />
        Except as otherwise provided in herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of you and us and
        are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.
        Save for any Group Entity who shall be entitled to enforce or enjoy the benefit of the terms of these Terms,
        a person who is not a party under these Terms has no right under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties)
        Act, Chapter 53B of Singapore to enforce or to enjoy the benefit of any term of these Terms.
        <br />
        <br />
        <div class="title">23. LANGUAGE</div>
        <br />
        You acknowledge that, solely for convenience, these Terms may be translated into a language other than
        English, and that a copy of the English language version of these Terms has been provided to you (which you
        have read and understand). In the event of conflict or ambiguity between the English language version and
        translated versions of these Terms, the English language version shall prevail.
        <br />
        <br />
        <div class="title">24. SEVERABILITY</div>
        <br />
        Whenever possible, each provision of these Terms will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and
        valid under applicable law, but if any provision or part-provision of these Terms is or becomes invalid,
        illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any law of any jurisdiction, it shall be deemed modified to
        the minimum extent necessary to make it valid, legal and enforceable. If such modification is not possible,
        the relevant provision or part-provision shall be deemed deleted. Any modification to or deletion of a
        provision or part-provision pursuant to this Clause 24 shall not affect or impair the validity and
        enforceability of the rest of these Terms, nor the validity and enforceability of such provision or
        part-provision under the law of any other jurisdiction.
        <br />
        <br />
        <div class="title">25. INTERPRETATION</div>
        <br />
        The language in these Terms will be interpreted as to its fair meaning, and not strictly for or against any
        party.
        <br />
        <br />
        <div class="title">26. ELECTRONIC CONSENTS</div>
        <br />
        You agree to be bound by any affirmation, assent or agreement that you transmit to the Seller or any Group
        Entity by computer or other electronic device, including internet, telephonic and wireless devices,
        including, but not limited to, any consent you give to receive communications from the Seller or any Group
        Entity solely through electronic transmission. You agree that when you click on an “I Agree,” “I Consent,”
        or other similarly worded button or entry field with your mouse, keystroke or other device, such agreement
        or consent will be legally binding and enforceable against you and will be the legal equivalent of your
        handwritten signature on an agreement that is printed on paper. You agree that the Seller or any Group
        Entity may send you electronic copies of any and all communications associated with your purchase of CETUS.
        <br />
        <br />
        <div class="title">27. NOTICES</div>
        <br />
        You agree and acknowledge that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that the

        These Terms have been entered into for and on behalf of the Seller. If you have any questions regarding
