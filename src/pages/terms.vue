        <!-- <br /> -->
        <br />
        This Terms of Use Agreement (these “Terms” or this “agreement”) covers the www.cetus.zone website, mobile
        user-interfaces and all its affiliate websites (collectively, the “Site”) provided by Cetus (“we,” “our,” or
        “us”), at times in conjunction with others. As part of the Site, we provide access to the decentralized
        peer-to-peer finance application (the “Cetus protocol”) managed and operated by holders of the Cetus governance
        token (the “Community”). The Cetus protocol is a decentralized exchange comprised of certain smart contracts
        deployed on the Aptos and Sui blockchain and related software development kits (collectively, the “Smart
        Contracts”) on
        which traders or liquidity providers of Aptos&SUI-based tokens tokens and other digital assets (collectively,
        “Digital
        Assets”) can transact on a peer-to-peer basis. The Cetus protocol is made up of free, public, open-source or
        source-available software, including a set of Smart Contracts. In addition to the Site, you can access the Cetus
        protocol through a number of third-party web or mobile user-interfaces that we do not own, administer or control
        (“UIs”).
        <br />
        <br />
        These Terms apply to you (“you” or “your”) as a user of our Site, including, without limitation, all the
        products, services, tools and information made available on the Site.
        <br />
        <br />
        You must be able to form a legally binding contract online either as an individual or on behalf of a legal
        entity. You represent that, if you are agreeing to these Terms on behalf of a legal entity, you have the legal
        authority to bind that entity to these Terms and you are not indirectly or directly included on any sanctions
        list and at least 18 years old or the age of majority where you reside, (whichever is older) can form a legally
        binding contract online, and have the full, right, power and authority to enter into and to comply with the
        obligations under these Terms.
        <br />
        <br />
        You are advised to periodically review these Terms so you understand any changes. We reserve the right, in our
        sole and absolute discretion, to make changes to our Terms. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising
        the “Last Updated” date at the beginning of these Terms accordingly. Changes are binding on users of the Site
        and will take effect immediately upon posting. As a user, you agree to be bound by any changes, variations, or
        modifications to our Terms and your continued use of the Site shall constitute acceptance of any such changes,
        revisions, variations, or modifications. By continuing to use the Site, you also acknowledge and agree that we
        have provided you with sufficient notice of such changes.

        <br />
        <div class="title">2. Use of the Site</div>
        <br />
        By using the Site, you expressly acknowledge and agree that:
        <br />
        <br />
        a. use of the Cetus protocol and/or Smart Contracts may require that you pay a fee, such as network fees and
        other charges needed to perform a transaction;
        <br />
        <br />
        b. your use of the Cetus protocol and/or Smart Contracts involves various risks, including, without limitation,
        risks of (a) losses while Digital Assets are being supplied to the Cetus protocol, (b) losses due to fluctuating
        prices of Digital Assets in trading pairs or liquidity pools and (c) losses due to bugs, errors, network outage,
        exploit incidents or any unforeseen circumstances;
        <br />
        <br />
        c. before using the Cetus protocol and/or Smart Contracts, you should review the relevant documentation to make
        sure you understand how the Cetus protocol and Smart Contracts work;
        <br />
        <br />

        d. you are responsible for doing your own diligence on the various UIs through which you access the Cetus
        protocol and/or Smart Contracts to understand the fees and risks they present;
        <br />
        <br />
        e. the Community has no control over any transactions conducted through the Cetus protocol and/or Smart
        Contracts, the method of payment of any transactions, or any actual payments of transactions, including, without
        limitation, use of any third-party services like Digital Asset wallet providers;
        <br />
        <br />
        f. you must ensure that you have a sufficient balance of the applicable Digital Assets stored at your compatible
        Digital Asset wallet address to complete any transaction on the Cetus protocol, Smart Contracts, or the Aptos
        network before initiating such transaction; and
        <br />
        <br />
        g. no individual or entity involved in creating the Cetus protocol or Smart Contracts will be liable for any
        claims or damages whatsoever associated with your use, inability to use, or your interaction with other users
        of, the Cetus protocol or Smart Contracts, including, without limitation, any direct, indirect, incidental,
        special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages, or loss of profits, Digital Assets, or anything else of
        value.

        <br />
        <br />
        You acknowledge that the Site and your use of the Site present certain risks, including without limitation the
        following risks:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Losses while digital assets are being supplied to the Cetus protocol and losses due to the fluctuation of
            prices of tokens in a trading pair or liquidity pool. Prices of digital currencies, tokens and/or other
            digital assets fluctuate day by day or even minute by minute. The value of your available balance could
            surge or drop suddenly. Please note that there is a possibility that the price of tokens could decrease to
            zero. Prices of tokens are prone to significant fluctuations, for example, due to announced proposed
            legislative acts, governmental restrictions, news related to cyber crimes or other factors causing
            potentially excessive market enthusiasm, disproportionate loss in confidence, or manipulation by others in
            the market.
          </li>
          <li>
            Risks associated with accessing the Cetus protocol through third party UIs. You are responsible for doing
            your own diligence on those UIs to understand and accept the risks that use entails. You are also
            responsible for doing your own diligence on those interfaces to understand and accept any fees that those
            interfaces may charge.
          </li>
          <li>Risks associated with any Smart Contracts with which you interact.</li>
          <li>
            Although we do not have access to your assets, you are reminded and acknowledge that at any time, your
            access to your Digital Assets through third-party Digital Asset wallet services, unrelated to the Site, may
            be suspended or terminated or there may be a delay in your access or use of your Digital Assets, which may
            result in the Digital Assets diminishing in value or you being unable to complete a Smart Contract.
          </li>
          <li>
            You are reminded of the inherent risks with digital assets and decentralized finance including the fact that
            tokens are not legal tender and are not backed by any government. Unlike fiat currencies, which are
            regulated and backed by local governments and central banks, tokens are based only on technology and user
            consensus, which means that in cases of manipulations or market panic, central governments will not take any
            corrective actions or measures to achieve stability, maintain liquidity or protect their value. There is a
            possibility that certain transactions cannot be settled or may be difficult to settle, or can be completed
            only at significantly adverse prices depending on the market situation and/or market volume. Transactions
            may be irreversible, and, accordingly, potential losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions are not
            recoverable. Some blockchain transactions are deemed to be completed when recorded on a public ledger, which
            is not necessarily the date or time when you or another party initiated the transaction.
          </li>
          <li>
            The regulatory frameworks applicable to blockchain transactions in connection with tokens are still
            developing and evolving. It is possible that your transactions or funds are, or may be in the future,
            subject to various reporting, tax or other liabilities and obligations. Legislative and regulatory changes
            or actions at the country or international level may materially and adversely affect the use, transfer,
            exchange, and value of your tokens.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Site and/or Cetus protocol may be entirely or partially suspended or terminated for any or no reason,
            which may limit your access to your Digital Assets.
          </li>
          <li>
            You are solely responsible for understanding and complying with any and all Applicable Laws in connection
            with your acceptance of these Terms and your use of any part of the Site, including but not limited to those
            related to taxes as well as reporting and disclosure obligations.
          </li>
          <li>
            This list of risk factors is non-exhaustive, and other risks, arising either now or in the future, could
            additionally be relevant and applicable to you in making an informed judgment to accept, or continue to
            accept, these Terms and/or use, or continue to use the Site.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <br />
        Accordingly, you expressly acknowledge and agree that:
        <br />
        <br />
        a. you assume all risk in connection with the specific risks identified above;
        <br />
        <br />
        b. you assume all risk in connection with your access to and use of the Site, the Cetus protocol and the Smart
        Contracts;
        <br />
        <br />
        c. that you expressly waive and release us, the Cetus protocol and the Community from any and all liability,
        claims, causes of action, responsibility or damages arising from or in any way related to your use of the Site,
        the Cetus protocol or the Smart Contracts;
        <br />
        <br />
        d. upgrades and modifications to the Cetus protocol are managed in a community-driven way by holders of the
        Cetus protocol governance token; and
        <br />
        <br />
        e. no individual or entity involved in creating the Cetus protocol will be liable for any claims or damages
        whatsoever associated with your use, inability to use, or your interaction with other users of, the Cetus
        protocol, including any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages, or
        loss of profits, Digital Assets, cryptocurrencies, tokens, or anything else of value.

        <div class="title">7. Indemnification</div>
        <br />
        You agree to indemnify and hold us and all of our officers, directors, council members, employees, contractors,

        <div class="title">8. General</div>
        <br />
        We may perform any of our obligations, and exercise any of the rights granted to us under these Terms, through

        personal, commercial or other purposes, all disputes, controversies or claims must be brought in the parties’

        <div class="title">9. Force Majeure</div>
        <br />
        There is a risk that transactions effected through the Site may be affected by system failures resulting from
        adverse events, natural disasters, pandemics and other emergencies, as well as unforeseen significant changes in
